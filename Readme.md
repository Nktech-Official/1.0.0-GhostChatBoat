    39 in the file name represent python version (39 means 3.9) you may have different version of python so replace the Python39 with your version The name is formed  by eleminating dot(.) from the version (e.g 3.7.0 will be 37 or 3.8.9 will be 38 etc.)
# Contribution / Development :


Feel free to edit the code and publish your version on your own profole or add your version to this directory.
you can add more query of your choice to perform different tasks

# Note:
Some query's may throw errors as the path of them were given according to my Pc so you have to give the correct location . to make it work correctly I am working on this so that it can automatically update the path  YOu can publish the solution if you find it first.

# Chrome/webbrowser():

chrome is set the browser to open different urls so if you have chrome browser installed just change the path at line 48 in Chrome function.

If you don't have chrome or want to open with other browser just change the path at line 48 & You can also change the Function name as it  is good practice . or you can use webbrowser.open() to open with default browser
